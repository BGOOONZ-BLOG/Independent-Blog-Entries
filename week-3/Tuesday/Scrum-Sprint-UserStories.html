<h1 id="scrum-overview"><strong>Scrum Overview</strong></h1>
<p><strong>“Scrum” Stands for …Nothing!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Scrum is not an acronym, it is a term taken from Rugby that refers to <em>a method of restarting a game after an accidental infringement, or when the ball has gone out of play</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Standard Scrum Process</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>There is no standardized process in Scrum.</p></li>
<li><p>Scrum is a <strong><code>framework</code></strong> for organizing and managing work.</p></li>
<li><p>Scrum is the leading contender in the pantheon of certified Agile software development methodologies.</p></li>
<li><p>The flip side is that an organization’s “unique practices and special approaches” can pollute the Scrum process.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Scrum Practices</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scrum is: “<em>a refreshingly simple, people-centric framework based on the values of honesty, openness, courage, respect, focus, trust, empowerment, and collaboration.</em>”</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>There are Four Dimensions to Scrum:
<ul>
<li>The roles of those who participate.</li>
<li>The activities in which a team will participate.</li>
<li>The artifacts created to manage the process.</li>
<li>The rules that bind the interactions of the roles, activities, and artifacts.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Scrum Roles</strong></p>
<p>There are three roles in Scrum.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Product Owner</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Provides leadership needed to define the product.</li>
<li>Decides which features and functionality to build and in which order to build them.</li>
<li>Responsible for overall success of the software.</li>
<li>They must be available at all times for any questions from the dev. team.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>The Scrum Master</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Helps the team understand and embrace the Scrum values and principles.</li>
<li>Provides process leadership.</li>
<li>Maintains productivity, and helps to remove roadblocks.</li>
<li>Acts as a leader, not a manager.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Development Team</strong>
<ul>
<li>Typically ranges from five to ten people per development team.</li>
<li>Large companies will have multiple pods of these dev teams.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Scrum Activities &amp; Scrum Artifacts</strong></p>
<p>Activites of a Scrum Team are simple to list and cycle over and over again.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Product owner has a vision of what needs to be created.</p></li>
<li><p>They take the vision and break it down into a list of features to add to a <strong><code>backlog</code></strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Product owner manages the backlog through a process called <strong><code>grooming</code></strong> that leaves the list in a prioritized order.</p></li>
<li><p>Dev process begins with <strong><code>Spring Planning</code></strong>, where the team forecasts how many features they will be able to complete in a set amount of time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><code>daily scrum</code></strong> is an adaptive planning activity where team members help coordinate their work through am inspection &amp; synchronization.</p></li>
<li><p>Sprint is completed with two introspection and adaptation activities: <strong><code>show and tell</code></strong> and <strong><code>sprint retrospective</code></strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Product Backlog</strong></p>
<p>While in maintenance mode of an on-going project, the backlog will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>New Features</li>
<li>Changes to Existing Features</li>
<li>Bugs</li>
<li>Fixes to Technical Debt</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sprints</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sprints can be for up to a month.</li>
<li>The work completed after every spring should create something of <em>tangible value</em>.</li>
<li>Sprints are always <strong><code>timeboxed</code></strong> so they always have a fixed start and end date.</li>
<li>New sprints will always follow the completion of an old sprint.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sprint Planning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Goal is to agree on what the upcoming sprint is supposed to achieve.</li>
<li>Agree on a sustainable pace.</li>
<li><strong><code>Sprint Backlog</code></strong> : Second backlog that includes breakdown of tasks for targeted features and associated backlogs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Running the Sprint</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Daily Scrum</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Daily Scrum/Daily Stand-Up</strong> : 15 min. meeting held in the am where each team member answers three questions:
<ul>
<li>What did I accomplish yesterday?</li>
<li>What do I hope to accomplish today?</li>
<li>What obstacles or impediments prevent me from making progress?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Done</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sprint results should be <strong>“shippable”</strong> meaning the team needs to define what their definition of “done” is.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Show and Tell</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Opportunity to see what everyone on the team has created.</li>
<li>The most important part is the conversation that ensues after presentation.</li>
<li>Successful review results in information flowing in both directions.</li>
<li>It is a scheduled opportunity to inspect and adapt the product.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sprint Retrospective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Time taken to dicuss what is not working with all of the development practices.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Then it all repeats!</strong></p>
