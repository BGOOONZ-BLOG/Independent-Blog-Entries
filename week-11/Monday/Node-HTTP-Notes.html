<ul>
<li>Regular Expression is a Pattern-Matching Machine</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="urls"><strong>URLS</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>URL</strong> : Uniform Resource Locator.</li>
<li>There are two important acronyms to understanding how the internet works: IETF &amp; RFC.</li>
<li><strong>IETF</strong> : Internet Engineering Task Force.
<ul>
<li>Open standards organization that creates voluntary standards to maintain and improve the usability and interoperability of the Internet.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>RFC</strong> : Request for Comments.
<ul>
<li>Document created by programmers, engineers, and scientists in the form of a memorandum.</li>
<li>When enough people have reviewed the RFC, the IETF will change it’s status to ‘Internet Standard’ which means that everyone should comply with if they decide to implement the standard.</li>
</ul></li>

<p><strong>What is this “resource” thing?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The term resource is always used in a general sense for whatever might be identified by a URI.
<ul>
<li>Common examples include an electronic document, an aimge or a source of information with a consistnet purpose.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The components of a URL</strong> <img src="https://gyazo.com/2a8d2d4dba6c6ffd21543fc74ff1e473" alt="pic" /></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Scheme</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Used to be called the ‘protocol’.</li>
<li>The protocol the browser uses to locate the resource using a Uniform Resource Locator.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Things between the scheme and authority</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The characters ‘://’ must exist between the scheme and the authority.</li>
<li>Thanks to Sir Tim Berners-Lee.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>The Authority</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Contains the domain name of the resource that has the resource that you’re trying to access.</li>
<li>Sometimes also includes a port number.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>The Path</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>First part of an HTTP request.</li>
<li>If a path is omitted from a URl, it is assumed to be ‘/’.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>The Query</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Extra information sent to the browser meant for the processing of a request.</li>
<li>URL encoded key-value pairs with an equal sign between them.</li>
<li>Entries are concatenated with ampersand symbol.</li>
<li>If a value is not correct is becomes URL encoded with it’s hexadecimal ASCII Code.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Fragment</strong>
<ul>
<li>Never sent to the server.</li>
<li>Tells the browser to access a specific section of the page after it loads.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reading RFCs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>RFC’s are basically unappealing and technical, not fun to read at all.</li>
</ul>
