<p><strong>1. The three pillars of object-oriented programming</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>Encapsulation</code></strong>
<ul>
<li>Put behavior and the data it works on together in a CLASS.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong><code>Inheritance</code></strong>
<ul>
<li>JS supports a type of implementation inheritance through a mechnism called prototypal inheritance.</li>
<li><code>Implementation</code>: Data and methods defined on a parent class are avail. on objects created from classes that inherit from those parent classes.</li>
<li><code>Prototypal</code>: JS uses prototype objects to make its implementation inheritance work not just on classes but on all objects.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong><code>Polymorphism</code></strong>
<ul>
<li>In OOP, polymorphism means that you can treat a variable as if it were on of its parent types. <strong>2. How to apply the Law of Demeter</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Law of Demeter helps to reduce coupling between components.</li>
<li>“THE ONE DOT RULE”</li>
<li>Easiest way to comply with the Law of Demeter is don’t use more than one dot.</li>
<li>A method of an object can only invoke the methods of the following type of objects:
<ol type="1">
<li>other methods on the object.</li>
<li>any objects passed into parameters.</li>
<li>any objects created in the method.</li>
<li>any values stores in the instance variables.</li>
<li>values in global variables.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
